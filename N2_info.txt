Brief: 

We consider a group of agents that perform simple or cyclic pursuit in different scenarios. We are interested in the type of curves plotted in the persecution, the existence of partial captures or total collapse of the agents in a single point, dependence of the curves with respect to initial conditions, different orders of persecution between agents, etc.
